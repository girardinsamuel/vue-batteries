> Base components and utilities to avoid reinventing the wheel each time and being stuck with strongly opiniated HTML structures and styles.

`vue-batteries` <Badge text="alpha"/> is a plugin for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). It is a functional components and utilities framework to ease components development and avoid. It plays nicely with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) but can also be used with any other CSS definitions.

:::warning âš¡ This plugin uses vue-composition-api
This plugin is made with [vue-composition-api](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api) which will be integrated into Vue 3 relase. The plugin will be updated with Vue 3 as soon as it will be released ([during Q2 2020](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/projects/6)). For now to be able to use it with Vue 2, `vue-composition-api` must be installed in your app ([more on that](/installation))
:::

ðŸš€ Main features:

- Tree-shakable components imports
- Global style configuration with themes
- Global style disabling to use only functional part
- Use only functional part of components without HTML structure
- Renderless components
- Useful utils often needed in an app

If you want a fully-featured UI framework like BootstrapVue, Vuetify or others this plugin might not be for you... but if you want low-level components with customizable CSS and HTML structure you're at the right place ! ðŸ˜ƒ
