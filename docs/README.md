# Vue Batteries

![Vue Batteries logo](/vue-batteries/assets/img/logo.png)

`vue-batteries` <Badge text="alpha"/> is a plugin for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). It is a functional components and utilities framework to ease components development and avoid to reinvent the wheel each time. It plays nicely with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) but can also be used with any CSS definitions.

Features include:

- Tree-shakable components imports
- Global style configuration with themes
- Global style disabling
- Use only functional part of components without HTML structure
- Renderless components

If you want a fully-featured UI framework like BootstrapVue, Vuetify or others this plugin might not be for you.

But if you want low-level components with customizable CSS and HTML structure you're at the right place ! ðŸ˜ƒ
